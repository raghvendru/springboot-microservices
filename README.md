Employee Project - Microservices Architecture
This project is built using a robust microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, resilience, and seamless communication between services.

Key Microservices & Architecture Components:
Microservices Implemented:

Employee Service â€“ Manages employee-related operations.
Department Service â€“ Handles department-related functionalities.
Organisation Service â€“ Manages organizational-level operations.
Each microservice is independently deployable and registered with the Service Registry.
Inter-Service Communication:

REST API via RestTemplate (synchronous calls).
WebClient for reactive, non-blocking communication.
Spring Cloud OpenFeign for declarative HTTP client calls.
Service Discovery & Load Balancing:

Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Server for service registration & discovery.
All microservices are auto-registered with Eureka Server.
API Gateway:

Implemented using Spring Cloud API Gateway for routing and centralized authentication.
Provides load balancing, security, and request filtering before hitting microservices.
Configuration Management:

Spring Cloud Config Server for externalized and centralized configuration management.
Dynamic updates without redeploying microservices.
Distributed Tracing & Monitoring:

Spring Cloud Sleuth for tracing requests across microservices.
Zipkin used to visualize trace information via UI, improving observability.
Circuit Breaker & Resilience Patterns:

Resilience4j for:
Circuit Breaking (Open-Close Fallback Mechanism).
Retry Pattern to handle transient failures gracefully.
Version Upgrades & Migration:

Migrated from Spring Boot 2.x to Spring Boot 3.x.
Addressed compatibility issues and applied best practices.
Containerization & Deployment:

Dockerized all microservices using Docker Compose & Docker Networks.
Inter-container communication managed efficiently.
Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka:

Implemented Kafka Producers & Consumers.
Message formats handled in String & JSON formats.
Topics used for decoupled microservices communication.
Tech Stack:
Spring Boot, Microservices, Spring Cloud (Eureka, OpenFeign, API Gateway, Config Server, Sleuth, Zipkin, Resilience4j)
MySQL for persistent data storage.
Unit Testing & Integration Testing with JUnit 5.
Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging.
Docker & Docker Compose for containerized deployment.
This project successfully demonstrates a highly scalable and resilient microservices architecture while implementing best practices in inter-service communication, observability, fault tolerance, and cloud-native deployment. ðŸš€
